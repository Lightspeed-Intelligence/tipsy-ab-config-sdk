# ── instruction block for Claude Code ──────────────────────────────────────
# When this script runs inside a Claude Code background bash task, the entire
# stderr above is fed back into the main conversation on completion. The block
# below is written for Claude to consume directly: it spells out the next-step
# loop (fetch review comments → understand each one → fix the real issues →
# push again) using concrete gh commands, so no human roundtrip is needed for
# the "address review feedback" step.
#
# Trigger model (intentionally signal-only, not semantic):
#   We do NOT try to grep review-bot output for "APPROVE" strings. The bot is
#   itself an LLM; its wording is non-deterministic, and even an APPROVE often
#   ships with non-blocking suggestions that we still want to evaluate. So the
#   script's only job is to detect whether *anything new* has happened since
#   the current HEAD was pushed, and hand the actual judgment (real issue vs.
#   false positive, blocking vs. nit) over to Claude.
#
# We emit the next-step block when ANY of these hold:
#   - new top-level issue comments since HEAD push time
#   - new inline review (PR review) comments since HEAD push time
#   - new review submissions since HEAD push time (APPROVE / CHANGES_REQUESTED
#     events themselves count as new activity to inspect)
#   - any unresolved review threads (regardless of age — an old unresolved
#     thread still represents debt the loop has not closed)
#
# When none of the above hold, the script exits silently with a single success
# line, so an automated loop reaches a stable terminal state.
